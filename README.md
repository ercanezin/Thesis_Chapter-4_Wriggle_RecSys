# # Wriggle Recommender System  designed for Chapter 4
</div>

This repository is created for Chapter 4 of the thesis titled 'Towards Context-Aware Recommender Systems for Tourists'.

# Important Warning:  Due To the NDA signed with Wriggle, we unfortunately cannot share the database used for our experiments. However, we hope that these experiment files can help anyone who wants to set up a similar system for their recommender systems.


# Abstract 

Novel datasets are one of the important opportunities to improve existing algorithms and explore new methods in Next-\ac{POI} recommendations. A local online company has kindly provided their dataset for us to explore a novel personalisation solution that recommends customised restaurant deals for city residents or visitors by filtering relevant information based on their food and drink preferences, restaurant popularity, proximity to the user's location, and availability of deals. Unlike previous work that recommends actual venues based on their menus, we focus on suggesting specific deals offered by restaurants partly due to the request by the company to test the method on a real application setting. The effectiveness of our approach was demonstrated through a real case study that utilised the dataset provided by the local company Wriggle, a platform for discovering local deals in various cities across England.

# Getting Started
  
  You need Python 3.7 and higher to run the codes and you need the latest version of the following packages to run both codes and jupyter notebook. The list of this package is in the requirements.txt file. Please use pip to install it.
 

	Files and their usage
 
 	Models -- Contains  models that match the database tables on MongoDB.
	RunExperiments.py -- Contains methods that we used to run experiments.
